# Ethereum Address Information Tool

This tool is a simple script that uses the `ethers.js` library to retrieve and display information about Ethereum addresses. It provides insights into the balance, transaction count, and account type (Externally Owned Account or Contract) associated with each address on the Ethereum mainnet.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or copy the script to a local file.

2. Install the required dependencies using npm:

```sh
npm install ethers
```

## Usage

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the script using Node.js:

```sh
node your-script-name.js
```

Replace `your-script-name.js` with the name of the file containing the provided code.

3. The script will interact with the Ethereum mainnet and provide information about the specified Ethereum addresses, including their balance in Ether (ETH), transaction count, and account type.


## Important Notes

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection to interact with the Ethereum mainnet.

- Keep your Ethereum addresses secure.
